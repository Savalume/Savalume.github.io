  <h2 class="paragraph4"> For starters, This is my first year at Comp Camps. In the end i had a pretty good time with coding my website, learning how to code animation into a unity game, and meeting amazing new people with the same interst as me!
  Starting about what i learnt. well, let's just say i had a lot of help from everyone to make this website the greatest it could be, so, thank you very much to instutors, campers and of course Google! :)</li>
  <h3 class="paragraph5"> For coding i leant the basics of coding and a little bit of javascript. mostly used on my website is HTML, and css. Everyone who came to compcamp once knows that we primarily use Atom, a simple coding site which used in order to code up our own website which your seeing right now ;) Something I would like to do is take my knowledgeave to create a cool first person mystery game.( information on my project page) </li>
