   <p class="paragraph2">~MY PROJECT~  The game i've always wanted to make was a game based off of a dream i've had. It starts meeting the three main charcters Megan, Chris and Vincent. You will meet these characters in a small town named Crissentine. You three will adventure out into a forest and that's where you will take contol of the story. Your choices will effect the gameplay, so chose wisely ;)</p>
